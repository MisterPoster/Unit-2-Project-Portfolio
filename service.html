        <h2> <mark> ECO Club : 9th Grade - 10th Grade</mark> </h2>
        <p>
            ECO Club was the environmentalist club at Valley View. In freshman year, 
            I worked with this club to recycle bottles and cans, and to improve the garden. 
            I served over 20 hours throughout freshman year.
        </p>

        <h2> <mark> Mu Alpha Theta : </mark> <sup> Be there</sup> or <sub>be square</sub></h2>
        <p>
            Although I haven't had much experience in this club, I still would like to rejoin this club during my junior year.
            The reason I left was because I didn't have a proper channel of communication with the club(i.e smartphone), so I thought I
            would become out of place and not up to date with most meetings.

            Example Math Problem
        </p>

        <p> (2) <sup>x</sup> = (1/32)</p>
        <p> log <sub>2</sub> (2) <sup>x</sup> = x = log<sub>2</sub> (1/32)</p>
        <p> log<sub>2</sub> (1/32) = <mark>-5</mark> </p>
