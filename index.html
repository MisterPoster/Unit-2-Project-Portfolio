        <h2> A Brief History of Samuel </h2>
        <p>I was born in Los Angeles on May 25, 2003 and I moved a lot throughout Southern California. 
            For instance, only 10 years ago, I lived in West Covina. 
            Then around 2013, my family moved again to Moreno Valley where I've lived since.
            I got into STEM from a flyer in 5th grade and went through the process of becoming part of it.</p>

        <h2>Top 5 Colleges I'm Interested Into </h2>
        <dl>
            <dt> Carnegie Mellon University </dt>
            <dd> I want to do something involving Artifical Intelligence, and some research showed that this school has the best programs
                for Artifical Intelligence. </dd>
            <dt> Massachusetts Institute of Technology</dt>
            <dd> As a school of internationally high status, I would particularly do well in their hyper math-based
                environment and culture. </dd>
            <dt>University of California - Berkeley</dt>
            <dd> This school reminds me of a Western Ivy League, only much more closer to home. </dd>
            <dt> Princeton University </dt>
            <dd> As everyone's to-go school for generations, this is definitely my choice if I needed a new experience on the East.</dd>
            <dt> University of Southern California </dt>
            <dd> This is probably my first choice for a safety school, but the campus would distract me since it is in the midst of LA.</dd>
