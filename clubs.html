        <h2> <i> <mark> Eagle News : 9th Grade </mark> </i> </h2>

        <p>
            Eagle News was the former Newspaper Club at Valley View. Although this club was small, it allowed for me to gain some written experiences in journalism. For instance,
            I wrote about an interview I had with one of the water polo girls after a recent victory.

        <h2> <i> <mark> National Honors Society : Present</mark> </i> </h2>
        <p>
            One of the newest clubs I have joined is National Honors Society. I am truly excited for the opportunites
            and experiences I can have while in this club. However, I am still having a goal to get its senior awards for my senior year.
